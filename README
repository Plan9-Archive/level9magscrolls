This repository contains ports to Plan 9 of interpreters for
interactive games made by Magnetic Scrolls and Level 9.  The porting
required minimal changes from the originals versions.  Their license
files are contained in the respective subdirectories, as is that of
the cheapglk library they are built against.

Run the buildall script to compile and install them under the names
"magnetic" and "level9".  You will need to find copies of the
interactive fiction games they work with separately.
